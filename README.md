This project is the client-side of the messenger application called Echo. This repository is part of a larger project that was made as a study project in a course. During the course, we ran the project only on a local server.

### Installation:
We used the following libraries: react-bootstrap, react-router, react-router-dom, and @microsoft/signalr.

### How does it look like?
Let's take a tour. The first screen is:

And now you can move to the sign-up screen:

After this, you can finally move to the main screen of the application with all chats:
